IMPORTANT ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- CRITICAL: Generate the entire report in the same language as the transcript. If the transcript is in Hebrew, write the report in Hebrew. If in English, write in English. Match the language exactly.
- CRITICAL: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any markdown formatting, explanatory text, or content outside the JSON object.
- Use the actual session information provided above instead of placeholders. Replace any [Insert X] placeholders with the real data provided.
- Carefully read through the transcript to identify different speakers based on context clues, names mentioned, and conversation flow
- Look for patterns like "Tony said", "Carrie responded", or changes in speaking style/topic that indicate different speakers
- If the transcript lacks clear speaker identification, do your best to infer from context but acknowledge the limitation
- Pay attention to who is asking questions vs. providing answers, as this often indicates different roles
- Note if this appears to be a monologue, dialogue, or multi-participant meeting
